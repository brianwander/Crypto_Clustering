# Crypto_Clustering
This notebook uses unsupervised machine learning to cluster cryptocurrencies into groups according to price changes and principal component analysis (PCA) of the price changes.



## Technologies
This notebook runs on jupyter labs using python 3.7.15
The program uses the pandas, hvplot and sklearn libraries.

## Installation Guide
Install python 3.7.15 and open crypto_investments.ipynb using jupyter lab, ensuring that the crypto_market_data.csv file containing the data is in the Resources folder.

To install the latest version of sklearn use the following command:

pip install -U scikit-learn

To install the latest version of hvplot use the following command:

pip install hvplot

Pandas can be installed by downloading the Anaconda python distribution and following the installation instructions.

## Usage
The code runs directly in the jupyter notebook. The graphs can be manipulated to look for trends in the data such as cryptocurrency clusters or changes in inertia with respect to the number of clusters.
